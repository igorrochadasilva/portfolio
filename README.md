# Portfolio FullStack Developer

Hello! I'm Igor Rocha, a fullstack developer with five years of experience. My passion for technology has led me to web development, where I create a variety of digital products. On the front end, I use React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Sass, and Vite or Next.js. With Apollo Client and GraphQL, I build dynamic and efficient interfaces, prioritizing usability. On the backend, I rely on Node.js and NestJS, combined with PostgreSQL, TypeORM, or Prisma to ensure secure data storage. I master Docker for app portability and consistency. I develop everything from websites and blogs to e-commerce sites, email marketing, dashboards, and internal systems, offering ongoing maintenance and support. For code quality, I use Jest and Vitest for automated testing, ensuring product stability and reliability. I'm ready to turn your ideas into digital reality!
